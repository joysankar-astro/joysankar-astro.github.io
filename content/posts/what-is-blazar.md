In the universe, we know that most of the galaxies have a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center ot them. When the SMBH is active, the central part of the galaxy is called an active galactic nucleus (AGN). AGNs can launch a bipolar relativistic jet. If a jetted AGN has a jet directed towards us (the angle between the axis of the jet to us ranges from 0&deg; - 15&deg;), then we call it a blazar.
