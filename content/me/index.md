I'll be joining as a PhD student at the **University of Warsaw**, advised by Prof. Dr. Łukasz Wyrzykowski and co-advised by Dr. Mariusz Gromadzki. I'm drawn to high-energy extragalactic transients - moments of cosmic beauty, fleeting yet powerful, like a sudden burst of আলো in the vast darkness.

I belong to a small village named Thakurpura in the district of South Dinajpur in the state of West Bengal, India.

I have completed my schooling from **Barakail High School** and then completed my 12th from **Balurghat High School**. I obtained my BSc in Physics (Hons) degree from **Malda College** affiliated to **University of Gour Banga** in 2022. I obtained my MSc in Physics degree from **Banaras Hindu University** in 2024. Then I joined the High Energy Astrophysics Lab under the guidance of Dr. Raj Prince as a Research Assistant.
