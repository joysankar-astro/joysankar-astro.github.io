I am a PhD student at the **[Astronomical Observatory](https://www.astrouw.edu.pl/en/)** of the **[University of Warsaw](https://en.uw.edu.pl/)**, advised by [Prof. Dr. Łukasz Wyrzykowski](https://wyrzykow.wixsite.com/lukasz) and co-advised by [Dr. Mariusz Gromadzki](https://www.astrouw.edu.pl/mariusz-gromadzki/). I'm drawn to high-energy extragalactic transients - moments of cosmic beauty, fleeting yet powerful, like a sudden burst of আলো in the vast darkness.

I belong to a small village named Thakurpura in the district of South Dinajpur in the state of West Bengal, India.

I have completed my schooling from **Barakoil High School** and then completed my 12th from **[Balurghat High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balurghat_High_School)**. I obtained my BSc in Physics (Hons) degree from **[Malda College](https://maldacollege.ac.in/home.php)**, affiliated to **[University of Gour Banga](https://www.ugb.ac.in/)** in 2022. I obtained my MSc in Physics degree from **[Banaras Hindu University](https://www.bhu.ac.in)** in 2024. Then I joined the [High Energy Astrophysics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/hea-bhu/home) under the guidance of Dr. Raj Prince as a Research Assistant.
