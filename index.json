I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to high-energy extragalactic transients - moments of cosmic beauty, fleeting yet powerful, like a sudden burst of আলো in the vast darkness.\nI belong to a small village named Thakurpura in the district of South Dinajpur in the state of West Bengal, India.\nI have completed my schooling from Barakail High School and then completed my 12th from Balurghat High School. I obtained my BSc in Physics (Hons) degree from Malda College affiliated to University of Gour Banga in 2022. I obtained my MSc in Physics degree from Banaras Hindu University in 2024. Then I joined the High Energy Astrophysics Lab under the guidance of Dr. Raj Prince as a Research Assistant.\n","date":"8 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/me/","section":"Joysankar Majumdar","summary":"","title":"About me","type":"page"},{"content":" All blogs What is blazar? 8 August 2025\u0026middot;77 words\u0026middot;1 min ","date":"8 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/","section":"Joysankar Majumdar","summary":"","title":"Blogs","type":"page"},{"content":"Some codes are listed below - joysankar-astro/XRT-Product-Extractor For extracting data from Swift XRT online product builder\u0026rsquo;s result Jupyter Notebook 0 0 joysankar-astro/GNSS-Data-Downloader Small python package to download GNSS n \u0026amp; o data from IGS stations.

When the SMBH is active, the central part of the galaxy is called an active galactic nucleus (AGN). AGNs can launch a bipolar relativistic jet. If a jetted AGN has a jet directed towards us (the angle between the axis of the jet to us ranges from 0° - 15°), then we call it a blazar.\n","date":"8 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/what-is-blazar/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"What is blazar?","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
